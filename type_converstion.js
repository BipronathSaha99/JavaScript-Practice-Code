/*
You have two variable one of them is string type which value is 5628, and another one is integer which
is 255, make add operation between them, and keep the answer in integer type variable, and finally
print the result. 
*/
// solution is given bellow:


let str = "5628", num = 255;
let sum = Number(str) + num;
console.log(`The result is = ${sum}`);

//by taking user defined variable
/*
let stringValue = prompt("Enter the string value: ");
let num = parseInt(prompt("Enter the integer value: "));
let convstringValue= Number(stringValue);
let add = convstringValue+num;
console.log(`The result is =${add}`);
